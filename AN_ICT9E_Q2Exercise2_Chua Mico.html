			<p class="para1"><span>[Verse 1:]</span><br>
			I used to rule the world<br>
			Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
			Now in the morning, I sleep alone<br>
			Sweep the streets I used to own<br><br>

			<span>[Interlude]</span><br><br>

			<span>[Verse 2:]</span><br>
			I used to roll the dice<br>
			Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes<br>
			Listen as the crowd would sing<br>
			"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"ㅤㅤ<br>
			One minute, I held the key<br>
			Next, the walls were closed on me<br>
			And I discovered that my castles stand<br>
			Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br>
			[Chorus: Chris Martin]<br>
			I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>
			Roman cavalry choirs are singin'<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			Once you'd gone, there was never<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			And that was when I ruled the world<br><br>

			<span>[Chorus:]</span><br>
			I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>
			Roman cavalry choirs are singin'<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			Once you'd gone, there was never<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			And that was when I ruled the world<br><br>

			<span>[Interlude]</span><br><br>

			<span>[Verse 3: Chris Martin]</span><br>
			It was the wicked and wild wind<br>
			Blew down the doors to let me in<br>
			Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br>
			People couldn't believe what I'd become<br>
			And revolutionaries wait<br>
			For my head on a silver plate<br>
			Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)<br>
			Aw, who would ever wanna be king?<br></p>


			<p class="para2"><span>[Chorus:]</span><br>
			I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>
			Roman cavalry choirs are singin'<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			But that was when I ruled the world<br><br>

			<span>[Bridge]</span><br>
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
			Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br><br>

			<span>[Chorus:]</span><br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'<br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			Roman cavalry choirs are singin'<br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			For some reason I can't explain<br>
			(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
			I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
			Never an honest word<br>
			But that was when I ruled the world<br><br>

			<span>[Outro]</span><br>
			Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm<br>
			Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm<br>
			Mmm, mmm<br><br></p>
