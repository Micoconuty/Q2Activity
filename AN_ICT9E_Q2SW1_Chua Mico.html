					<td>Known for their gentle, laid-back personalities, sweet faces and round eyes, Persian cats are affectionate, quiet, beautiful creatures of habit, making them the most popular breed among cat fanciers.</td>
					<td>It is believed that the Romans brought the British shorthair to England during the first century, at which time the breed co-existed and bred with wild cats native to England. Many years later, the British shorthair was crossbred with Persian cats, slightly changing the look of the cat and improving the thickness of its fur coat.</td>
					<td>Easygoing and loving, ragdoll cats get their name from their tendency to relax and go limp in one’s arms when picked up. One of the largest breeds of cats, ragdolls are also one of the most affectionate, often referred to as “puppy-cats” because of their dog-like personality.</td>
					<td>One of the oldest natural breeds in North America, Maine Coon cats are known for their intelligence and playfulness, as well as their size. One of the largest breeds of domestic cats, they are lovingly referred to as “gentle giants.”</td>
					<td>The Sphynx, a hairless, wrinkled wonder with big ears and eyes and pronounced cheekbones is one of the newer cat breeds. The first Sphynx was born in Canada in 1966, according to the CFA. The lack of hair, a genetic anomaly, was a result of Mother Nature and occurs about once every 15 years.</td>
					<td>Abys, as they are lovingly called, are elegant and regal-looking, easy to care for and make ideal pets for cat lovers.</td>
